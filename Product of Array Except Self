Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all 
the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of 
space complexity analysis.)

From the looks of it, this seems like a simple enough problem to solve in linear time and space. 
We can simply take the product of all the elements in the given array and then, for each of the elements x of the array, 
we can simply find product of array except self value by dividing the product by x.

Doing this for each of the elements would solve the problem. However, there's a note in the problem which says that we are not 
allowed to use division operation. That makes solving this problem a bit harder.

Approach 1: Left and Right product lists

It's much easier to build an intuition for solving this problem without division once you visualize how the different products 
except self look like for each of the elements. So, let's take a look at an example array and the different products.

Looking at the figure about we can figure another way of computing those different product values.

    Instead of dividing the product of all the numbers in the array by the number at a given index to get the corresponding 
    product, we can make use of the product of all the numbers to the left and all the numbers to the right of the index. 
    Multiplying these two individual products would give us the desired result as well.

For every given index, i, we will make use of the product of all the numbers to the left of it and multiply it by the product of 
all the numbers to the right. This will give us the product of all the numbers except the one at the given index i. Let's look at 
a formal algorithm describing this idea more concretely.

Algorithm

    1. Initialize two empty arrays, L and R where for a given index i, L[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the 
       left of i and R[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the right of i.
    2. We would need two different loops to fill in values for the two arrays. For the array L, L[0] would be 1 since there are 
       no elements to the left of the first element. For the rest of the elements, we simply use L[i]=L[i−1]∗nums[i−1]. Remember that 
       L[i] represents product of all the elements to the left of element at index i.
    3. For the other array, we do the same thing but in reverse i.e. we start with the initial value of 1 in R[length−1] where 
       length is the number of elements in the array, and keep updating R[i] in reverse. Essentially, R[i]=R[i+1]∗nums[i+1]. 
       Remember that R[i] represents product of all the elements to the right of element at index i.
    4. Once we have the two arrays set up properly, we simply iterate over the input array one element at a time, and for each 
       element at index i, we find the product except self as L[i]∗R[i].

        //the left and right arrays as described in the algorithm
        int[] L = new int[length];
        int[] R = new int[length];
        
        //final answer array to be returned
        int[] answer = new int[length];
        
        //L[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
        //note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
        //so L[0] would be 1
        L[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            
            //L[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to be the left of 'i - 1'

            //for the last element of the array, product except self would be L[i]

Approach 2: O(1) space approach

Although the above solution is good enough to solve the problem since we are not using division anymore, there's a follow-up 
component as well which asks us to solve this using constant space. Understandably so, the output array does not count towards 
the space complexity. This approach is essentially an extension of the approach above. Basically, we will be using the output 
array as one of L or R and we will be constructing the other one on the fly. Let's look at the algorithm based on this idea.

Algorithm

    1. Initialize the empty answer array where for a given index i, answer[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the 
       left of i.
    2. We construct the answer array the same way we constructed the L array in the previous approach. These two algorithms are 
       exactly the same except that we are trying to save up on space.
    3. The only change in this approach is that we don't explicitly build the R array from before. Instead, we simply use a 
       variable to keep track of the running product of elements to the right and we keep updating the answer array by doing 
       answer[i]=answer[i]∗R. For a given index i, answer[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left and R would 
       contain product of all the elements to the right. We then update R as R=R∗nums[i].
